* Short Description *

These are the Rent N' Ride mobile application screens that help the users have a smooth and visually satisfying sign-up and login process.

Login Screen:

The login screen helps the existing users sign in to their accounts with their email/username and password. It provides password recovery and links to the sign-up page. The interface has a focus on simplicity, simplicity, and ease of use with a clean blue-and-white color scheme.

Sign-Up Screen:

The sign-up page allows new users to register an account. It is branded and laid out consistently with the login page to provide an integrated user experience. Every input field is labeled properly, and the interface promotes easy transitions from login to sign-up activity.

I created both the Sign-Up and Login screens with emphasis on user-centric UI, simple layout, and brand harmony. I applied soft gradients, round containers, and shadowing for providing depth and trendy aesthetic appeal, thereby improving the app's overall visual appearance and interface.
